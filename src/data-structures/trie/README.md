## Trie

According to Wikipedia:

> In computer science, a trie, also called digital tree, radix tree or prefix tree is a kind of search tree—an ordered tree data structure used to store a dynamic set or associative array where the keys are usually strings. Unlike a binary search tree, no node in the tree stores the key associated with that node; instead, its position in the tree defines the key with which it is associated. All the descendants of a node have a common prefix of the string associated with that node, and the root is associated with the empty string. Keys tend to be associated with leaves, though some inner nodes may correspond to keys of interest. Hence, keys are not necessarily associated with every node. For the space-optimized presentation of prefix tree, see compact prefix tree.

> In the example shown, keys are listed in the nodes and values below them. Each complete English word has an arbitrary integer value associated with it. A trie can be seen as a tree-shaped deterministic finite automaton. Each finite language is generated by a trie automaton, and each trie can be compressed into a deterministic acyclic finite state automaton.

Take a look at the following trie:-

A **trie** is a `tree-like` data structure whose nodes store the letters of an alphabet. By structuring the nodes in a particular way, words and strings can be retrieved from the structure by traversing down a branch path of the tree.

Tries in the context of computer science are a relatively new thing. The first time that they were considered in computing was back in *1959*, when a Frenchman named **René de la Briandais** suggested using them. According to Donald Knuth’s research in *The Art of Computer Programming*:

> Trie memory for computer searching was first recommended by René de la Briandais. He pointed out that we can save memory space at the expense of running time if we use a linked list for each node vector, since most of the entries in the vectors tend to be empty.

**Trie** is an efficient information re**Trie**val data structure. Using Trie, search complexities can be brought to optimal limit (key length). If we store keys in binary search tree, a well balanced BST will need time proportional to <img src="/assets/m-log-n.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=57.27448814999999pt height=24.65753399999998pt/>, where **M** is maximum string length and **N** is number of keys in tree. Using Trie, we can search the key in <img src="/assets/big-o-of-m.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=57.27448814999999pt height=24.65753399999998pt/> time. However the penalty is on Trie storage requirements.
