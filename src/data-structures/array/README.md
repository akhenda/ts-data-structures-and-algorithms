## Array

According to Wikipedia:

> An Array data structure, or simply an Array, is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements (values or variables), each identified by at least one array index or key. The simplest type of data structure is a linear array, also called one-dimensional array.

Arrays are among the oldest and most important data structures and are used by every program. They are also used to implement many other data structures.
