## Max Heap

According to Tutorialspoint:

> **Heap** is a special case of balanced binary tree data structure where the root-node key is compared with its children and arranged accordingly. If **α** has child node **β** then −
>
> **key(α) ≥ key(β)**
>
> As the value of parent is greater than that of child, this property generates **Max Heap**

```

```

**Min-Heap** − Where the value of the root node is less than or equal to either of its children.

**Max-Heap** − Where the value of the root node is greater than or equal to either of its children.

Both trees are constructed using the same input and order of arrival.
